# hello-world

I am Clem. From Chile.
I have beginner Python skills and have professional experience in pseudopseudocode.
I wish to become a Geologist or a Data Scientist, and am a sucker for Mathematics, Statistics, Informatics, and geoscience.
If things go well, I will pursue superior education in Europe.
